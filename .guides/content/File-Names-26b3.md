All files have a name which identifies them uniquely. In order to read or write a file, its name must be known. The name may include other information such as a path on a disk, a hostname, or a complete URI. 

Examples of different types of paths to a file with the same filename:

- `c:\folder1\filename.txt` (*MS-DOS disk path*)
- `/tmp/filename.txt` (*Unix-style disk path*)
- `\\COMPUTERNAME\folder\filename.txt` (*WINS network path*)
- `http://www.codio.com/filename.txt` (*a URL for a file on the web*)
- `ftp://user1@pass1:ftp.foo.com/folder1/filename.txt` (*a URL for an FTP address*)


For this introduction we will concern ourselves with regular files stored on a disk drive. Disk drive filenames typically include folders names as well as the fileâ€™s name.
