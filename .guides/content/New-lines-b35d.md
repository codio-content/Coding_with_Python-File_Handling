Did you notice how the first example displayed over 4 lines? This is because the new line characters in the file are carried across when displaying it. Those same new line characers tell Python when a line ends when you read the file line by line.

A common name for the new line is *carriage return*. This harks back to the days of the typewriter when a typist had to return the carriage mechanism back to the start of the line. 

We use this character to *delimit* (separate) one line from another. This is rather like we used the `,` to separate items in a list.
