This unit will teach you how to work with files in Python.

**File:**
*A file is a collection of data, stored on a durable medium so it can be used later.*

Files are **durable** because they survive after the program itself has ended, allowing the file to be used later. The term *file* comes from the way electronic files resemble paper files - they store information for later use.

You are probably familiar with files for things like: 

- documents
- spreadsheets
- images or videos
- MP3 for music
