All files have a name which identifies them uniquely. In order to read or write a file, it's name must be known. The name may include other information such as a path on a disk, a hostname, or a complete URL. 

Here are some examples pf different paths to a file:

- `c:\folder1\filename.txt` (*MS-DOS disk path*)
- `/tmp/filename.txt` (*Unix-style disk path*)
- `\\COMPUTERNAME\folder\filename.txt` (*WINS network path*)
- `http://www.codio.com/filename.txt` (*a URL for a file on the web*)
- `ftp://user1@pass1:ftp.foo.com/folder1/filename.txt` (*a URL for an FTP address*)


For this introduction you will use regular files stored on a disk drive. Disk drive filenames typically include folder names as well as the name of the file.
