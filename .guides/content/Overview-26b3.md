Files are used to store data permanently, even after a program exits. Typically, files are stored on some durable storage like a diskdrive and they are given a name. The data can be used at a later time by opening the file by its name and loading the data.

You are probably familiar with files for things like 

- documents
- spreadsheets
- images or videos
- MP3 for music

However, they can be used to store any kind of data like the things we worked on with 2 dimensional arrays in the last Unit.
