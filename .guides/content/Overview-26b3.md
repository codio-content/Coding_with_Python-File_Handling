Files are used to store data. More advanced applications use databases such as MySQL or MongoDB to store and retrieve large amounts of data in a flexible way.

But for many more basic applications, working with regular files is a simpler and very good way of storing and managing data.

You are probably familiar with files for things like 

- documents
- spreadsheets
- images

However, they can be used to store more structured data like the things we worked on with 2 dimensional lists in the last Unit.
