There are two types of file that are used, these file types are called text and binary. Binary is the term used to describe a normal file with binary data in it, which is generally not readable by a human. On the other hand, text files contain human-readable characters.
A text file is exactly like a binary file. The difference is that text files have an associated encoding type which explains how to translate the binary information into characters.
There are many encoding types that have been used over time, designed to support different languages which needed different characters that were not available previously.
