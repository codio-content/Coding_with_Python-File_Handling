This Unit will teach you how to work with Files.

**File:**
*A file is a collection of data, stored on a durable medium so it can be used later.*

Files are **durable** because they survive after the program itself has ended, allowing the file to be used later. The term *file* come from the way electronic files resemble paper files in that they store information for later use.

You are probably familiar with files for things like 

- documents
- spreadsheets
- images or videos
- MP3 for music
